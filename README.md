# Some Albums

## Fearless

Fearless (Taylor's Version) is a country music album that features guitars, banjo, violin, and strings. Swift's adolescent observations and feelings on love and heartbreak are depicted in the lyrics. Swift and Christopher Rowe produced all save the unreleased tracks to match the original recordings: they have identical compositions but with more defined and controlled instrumentation and voices. Swift collaborated with Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner to create the vault tracks, which have an indie/electronic backdrop provided by synths and drum programming. Maren Morris and Keith Urban provide guest vocals on two vault tracks.

Swift wrote Taylor Swift based on her personal teenage life experiences. While she followed the confessional songwriting style associated with country music, she avoided stereotypical themes like "tractors and hay bales because that's not really how I grew up." Instead, she wrote about her observations and reflections on topics ranging from romantic relationships to friendships, attempting to convey her adolescent viewpoints as honestly and personally as possible. Swift wrote songs whenever and wherever she wanted, from studio sessions to school breaks, because her inspirations came from immediate feelings and emotions. This practice produced straightforward lyrics that The Daily Telegraph described as "brimming with earnest naiveté."

## Folklore

The fictions inspired Swift to venture beyond her usual autobiographical style of songwriting, and experiment with different narrative standpoints. In isolation during the lockdown, she let her imagination "run wild", ensuing in a set of imageries and visuals that consequently became Folklore.

## Speak Now

I first made Speak Now, completely self-written, between the ages of 18 and 20. The songs that came from this time in my life were marked by their brutal honesty, unfiltered diaristic confessions and wild wistfulness. I love this album because it tells a tale of growing up, flailing, flying and crashing… and living to speak about it. — Swift looking back on Speak Now on her social media

## Red

The title refers to the tumultuous, extreme, "red" emotions evoked by unhealthy romantic relationships Swift was experiencing during the album's conception phase; these emotions ranged "from intense love, intense frustration, jealousy, confusion" and shaped the lyrics.

## 1989

1989 (Taylor's Version) is American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's fourth re-recorded album. It is a re-recording of Swift's fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), and was released by Republic Records on October 27, 2023. Swift's new album is part of her ongoing response to a 2019 dispute over the masters of her back catalog. It was revealed on August 9, 2023, at the closing event of the Eras Tour in Los Angeles.

## Reputation

The album's tracks, which are about rage, vengeance, and ultimately finding peace in love, were inspired by public celebrity feuds and romantic relationships. Swift produced Reputation, an electropop and R&B record containing elements of urban styles such as hip hop, trap, and EDM, mostly with Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, and Shellback. Its tightly structured electronic sound is distinguished by programmed drum machines, pulsing synths and bass, and altered vocals.

## Lover

Swift wrote Lover as a "love letter to love," drawing inspiration from her rebalanced personal life and newfound musical freedom. This idea was expressed through the production, which departs from the dark, hip hop-inspired tones of Reputation to embrace a light sound influenced by electropop, pop rock, and synth-pop. The songs are distinguished by ambient synthesizers, mid-tempo rhythms, and acoustic instruments. The songs' styles range from country and folk to funk and bubblegum pop. They delve into emotions like infatuation, commitment, desire, and heartbreak. A few talk about political themes like LGBT rights and feminism.

## Evermore

Swift described Evermore as an offshoot of "the folklorian woods"—an escapist, cottagecore-inspired direction she first imagined with Folklore during the COVID-19 pandemic; she considers the two albums to be sister albums. Evermore combines elements of alternative rock, indie folk, and chamber pop, with fingerpicked guitars, somber pianos, lavish strings, and sparse percussion. Its lyrical technique is dominated by Impressionist storytelling and mythopoeia. The topic has been described as an anthology of stories about love, marriage, infidelity, and grief that explore the complexities of human emotion. The album features guest appearances by American bands Bon Iver, Haim, and the National.

## Midnight

Midnights, inspired by Swift's "sleepless nights," delves into themes of anxiety, insecurity, self-criticism, self-awareness, insomnia, and self-confidence, with confessional yet cryptic lyricism. Sonically, it combines electropop, dream pop, and bedroom pop styles, resulting from an alternative approach to synth-pop that employs analog synthesizers, drum machines, subtle grooves, and hip hop/R&B rhythms. Swift revealed the standard track list for her TikTok series Midnights Mayhem with Me, which will run from September 21 to October 7, 2022.
