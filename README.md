### Fearless (Taylor's Version) is a country music album that features guitars, banjo, violin, and strings. Swift's adolescent observations and feelings on love and heartbreak are depicted in the lyrics. Swift and Christopher Rowe produced all save the unreleased tracks to match the original recordings: they have identical compositions but with more defined and controlled instrumentation and voices. Swift collaborated with Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner to create the vault tracks, which have an indie/electronic backdrop provided by synths and drum programming. Maren Morris and Keith Urban provide guest vocals on two vault tracks.

### The fictions inspired Swift to venture beyond her usual autobiographical style of songwriting, and experiment with different narrative standpoints. In isolation during the lockdown, she let her imagination "run wild", ensuing in a set of imageries and visuals that consequently became Folklore.

## Speak Now

I first made Speak Now, completely self-written, between the ages of 18 and 20. The songs that came from this time in my life were marked by their brutal honesty, unfiltered diaristic confessions and wild wistfulness. I love this album because it tells a tale of growing up, flailing, flying and crashing… and living to speak about it. — Swift looking back on Speak Now on her social media
